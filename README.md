## The Problem It Solves

AI drafts start fire, end generic. You edit for hours: killing hype, restoring edge, fact-checking ghosts.

**This ends that.** Load truth once. Generate flawless assets forever.

---

## What Makes It Magic

**Truth files** lock your reality. **Skills** nail every format. **Knowledge** compounds wins.

```
Truth → Skills → Knowledge → Repeatable domination
```

**Explorer UI** (new): Branded dashboard of your entire system. Static. Vercel-ready. Zero build.

## Key Capabilities

### Context-Driven Writing

- **Voice DNA**
  Tone, cadence, phrasing, boundaries
  Prevents generic “AI voice”

- **Ideal Client Profile (ICP)**
  Pains, desires, objections, real language
  Enables actual resonance

- **Business Profile**
  Offers, pricing logic, positioning
  Prevents invented facts

- **Claims Policy**
  What can and cannot be stated
  Enforces credibility-first output

---

### Skill-Based Asset Generation

Each content type has a dedicated **Skill**:

- landing pages
- sales decks
- emails
- blog posts
- LinkedIn content
- proposals

Skills define:

- structure
- inputs
- QA rules
- constraints

Voice and claims never live in Skills.

---

### Knowledge That Compounds

- **Gold-standard examples** (what “good” looks like)
- **Reusable templates** (CTAs, proof, objections)
- **Drafts and notes** kept explicitly non-canonical

The system improves with use instead of drifting.

---

### Writing System Explorer Features

- Static HTML / CSS / JS
- Root-relative paths (Vercel-safe)
- Markdown rendering (docs, prompts, skills)
- JSON rendering (context profiles)
- File metadata (path, version, trust level)
- Visual trust badges (canonical / reference / draft)
- Responsive and accessible by default

The repository remains the **single source of truth**.

---

## Core Weapons

### `/context/core/` – Your Unbreakable Foundation

- **Voice DNA**: Tone, phrasing, edge. No "AI slop."
- **ICP**: Real pains/objections. True resonance.
- **Business**: Offers/pricing. No invented features.
- **Claims**: Guardrails. Credibility enforced.

### `/skills/` – Format Mastery

One file per weapon:

- Landing pages ✓
- Cold emails ✓
- Sales decks ✓
- LinkedIn ✓
- Proposals ✓

Structure + QA baked in.

### `/knowledge/` – Gets Smarter

Your best work → fuel for next. Compounds instead of drifts.

---

## Drop & Dominate (2 Min Setup)

1. `git clone`
2. Run 3 creators → core JSON files
3. Point Claude/Cursor to `CLAUDE.md`
4. "Write my landing page" → _Done_

**Works everywhere:** Claude Projects, Cursor, ChatGPT files, local LLMs.

---

## Operators Only

For consultants, technical founders, productized services. Scale _your_ voice across touchpoints.

**Not for:** 50-client agencies or prompt tinkerers.

## Why It Wins

| Prompts               | This Kit            |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Repeat every time     | Load once           |
| Drifts + hallucinates | Enforced + truthful |
| 47 chat tabs          | One system prompt   |
| Manual QA             | Baked-in guardrails |
| Stagnant              | Compounds           |

**Philosophy:** Systems > inspiration. Truth > cleverness.

## Repository Structure (Canonical)

```text
/site/                → Explorer frontend (static)
/context/core/        → Source-of-truth JSON profiles
/prompts/             → Creator interview prompts
/skills/              → Content-type expertise
/knowledge/           → Examples, templates, references
/docs/                → Supporting documentation
/CLAUDE.md            → System contract
/archive/             → Versioned history
```

---

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Run creator prompts once:

   - `voice-dna-creator.md` → `voice-dna.json`
   - `icp-creator.md` → `icp.json`
   - `business-profile-creator.md` → `business-profile.json`

3. Point your AI tool to `CLAUDE.md`
4. Generate assets using natural language

No prompt engineering required.

---

## Supported Tools

- Claude Projects
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- ChatGPT
- Any RAG-capable system

Markdown + JSON.
No vendor lock-in.

---

## Philosophy

Structure beats prompts.
Truth beats cleverness.
Systems beat inspiration.

This kit is for people who want **repeatable clarity**, not AI theater.

**MIT. Fork it. Weaponize it.**
