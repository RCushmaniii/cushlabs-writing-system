# Context Engineering Kit (v2.0)

A modular, production-ready system for generating **high-leverage business assets**  
(landing pages, sales decks, case studies, posts, emails) that **strictly adhere to your voice, your audience, and your business logic**.

This is not a prompt library.  
It’s an **operating system for AI-assisted writing**.

---

## 🚀 Why This Exists

Most AI writing fails because it:

- sounds generic
- invents facts
- ignores positioning
- drifts over time
- can’t reuse what already worked

The Context Engineering Kit solves this by separating **truth**, **structure**, and **examples** into explicit, enforceable layers.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Context-Driven by Design

- **Voice DNA** → how you sound (tone, cadence, banned phrases)
- **ICP** → who you’re speaking to (pains, desires, objections)
- **Business Profile** → what you actually offer (no hallucinated pricing or features)

### 🧩 Skill-Based Asset Generation

- Each content type has a dedicated **Skill** (`SKILL.md`)
- Skills define structure, rules, QA checks, and constraints
- Reusable across landing pages, decks, emails, posts, and more

### 🧠 Memory That Compounds

- Store “gold standard” examples once
- Reuse tone, patterns, and phrasing automatically
- Keep drafts, notes, and templates cleanly separated

### 🛡️ Anti-Hype & Anti-Hallucination

- Claims are constrained by business reality
- No invented metrics, fake case studies, or marketing fluff
- Designed for credibility-first B2B communication

### 🪟 Windows-Friendly

- No hidden folders
- No special tooling required
- Works with Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Projects, ChatGPT, or any LLM

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Setup

Copy this repository into your project root.

### 2. Initialize the Core Profiles (The “Brain”)

Run these once to teach the system who you are:

1. **Voice DNA**

   - Open `/prompts/voice-dna-creator.md`
   - Paste into your AI chat
   - Save output to: `/context/core/voice-dna.json`

2. **ICP (Ideal Client Profile)**

   - Open `/prompts/icp-creator.md`
   - Paste into your AI chat
   - Save output to: `/context/core/icp.json`

3. **Business Profile**
   - Open `/prompts/business-profile-creator.md`
   - Paste into your AI chat
   - Save output to: `/context/core/business-profile.json`

### 3. Activate

Point your AI assistant to **`CLAUDE.md`**  
(or `.cursorrules` / project instructions) as the system prompt.

 ## 🧠 Core Profiles Explained

The system relies on a small set of **Source of Truth** files.
If output feels generic, inaccurate, or “AI-ish,” these are the first files to check.

| File | Purpose | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `voice-dna.json` | Tone, cadence, banned language | Prevents “AI marketing voice” |
| `icp.json` | Pains, goals, objections | Enables real resonance |
| `business-profile.json` | Offers, pricing logic, delivery | Prevents hallucinated claims |
| `claims-policy.json` | What may / may not be claimed | Enforces credibility |

## 🛠️ How Asset Generation Works

### 1. The Call (Natural Language)

You simply ask:

> “Write a landing page for the Clarity Sprint.”

### 2. The System Routes Automatically

- Detects the content type
- Loads the relevant **Skill**
- Loads **Core Context**
- Pulls examples from **Knowledge**
- Generates structured, on-brand output

No prompt engineering required.

---

## 🧩 Creating New Skills

Create a new Skill when you repeat a task more than twice.

1. Copy `/skills/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md`
2. Rename the folder (e.g. `/skills/twitter-thread/`)
3. Define:
   - Goal
   - Triggers
   - Inputs
   - Output format
   - Claims & QA rules

The system will automatically use the Skill when triggered.

---

## 🧠 Knowledge Layer (Why This Compounds)

### `/knowledge/content/`

- Finished, polished examples
- Shows what “good” looks like
- Referenced automatically for consistency

### `/knowledge/templates/`

Reusable blocks:
- CTAs
- Proof
- Bios
- Objection handling
- Microcopy

This is how the system **gets better over time instead of drifting**.

---

## 🔧 Maintenance & Troubleshooting

### The AI sounds generic
- **Check:** `voice-dna.json`
- **Fix:** Add better writing samples and re-run the creator

### The AI invents pricing or features
- **Check:** `business-profile.json`
- **Fix:** Update or re-run the profile

### The AI ignores Skill rules
- **Check:** Does the trigger phrase match?
- **Fix:** Make triggers explicit in `SKILL.md`

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Compatibility

- Markdown-based
- JSON for structured truth
- PowerShell-friendly

Works with:
- Claude Projects
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- ChatGPT
- Any RAG-enabled system

No vendor lock-in.
