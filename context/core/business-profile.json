  "positioning": "I build AI assistants that actually work in production—handling real customer questions, reducing support load, and converting website visitors—without hallucination risks or performance disasters. No demos that break in production. No hype-driven tools that need constant babysitting. Just secure, measurable systems backed by 17 years of Fortune 500 IT discipline.",

    "perspective": "first-person singular ('I,' 'my,' 'me')",
    "rationale": "Solo consultant positioning. Direct accountability. Use 'we' only when referring to collaboration with the client (e.g., 'we'll define success metrics together').",
