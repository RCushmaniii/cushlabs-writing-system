  "objections_and_rebuttals": {
    "price": {
      "objection": "This sounds expensive. We don't have $10K–$20K in the budget.",
      "rebuttal": "I hear you. Let's do the math: If you're handling 100 repetitive support tickets per week at $25/ticket in labor cost, that's $130K/year you're spending. If this system deflects even 50 tickets/week, it saves you $65K/year. A $12K investment pays for itself in ~10 weeks. After that, it's pure savings every year. Does that change how you're thinking about the cost?"
    },
    "bandwidth": {
      "objection": "We don't have time or people to manage a big AI project.",
      "rebuttal": "That's exactly why I built the Clarity Sprint model. You invest 3–5 hours of your time over one week, I deliver a complete plan. If you move forward, the project is fixed-scope—you're not managing developers or writing requirements. I own delivery. You review milestones. That's it."
    },
    "hallucination_risk": {
      "objection": "What if it gives wrong answers and damages our reputation?",
      "rebuttal": "Valid concern. Here's how I prevent that: (1) Every answer is grounded in YOUR approved content—no making things up. (2) Confidence thresholds—if the system isn't sure, it hands off to your team instead of guessing. (3) Source citations—customers see WHERE the answer came from. (4) Two weeks of post-launch tuning to catch edge cases. You're not launching a black box."
    },
    "data_security": {
      "objection": "Our data is sensitive. How do we know it's secure?",
      "rebuttal": "Great question. Here's the approach: (1) Role-based access—only authorized users see sensitive content. (2) Audit logs—you can see who accessed what and when. (3) Data minimization—we only load what the assistant needs to function. (4) Clear retention policies—your data, your rules. (5) Documented data flows before launch—no surprises. I bring Fortune 500 governance mindset to every project."
    },
    "past_failures": {
      "objection": "We tried a chatbot before and it was useless.",
      "rebuttal": "I hear that a lot. Most chatbots fail because they're built backwards—vendor picks a tool, then forces your use case into it. I do the opposite: define your problem, success metrics, and failure modes FIRST, then design a system that works. That's the Clarity Sprint. We figure out if AI even makes sense before you spend serious money. If your last vendor didn't do that, no wonder it failed."
    },
    "performance_seo": {
      "objection": "Will this slow down our website or hurt our SEO?",
      "rebuttal": "No. I validate Core Web Vitals before and after deployment. If the embed impacts performance, we move the assistant to a dedicated page or optimize the loading pattern. Your page speed and SEO are non-negotiable. I've seen too many vendors ship 'working' systems that tank a client's Google rankings. Not happening here."
    },
    "diy_alternative": {
      "objection": "Can't we just use ChatGPT, Intercom, or hire a cheaper freelancer?",
      "rebuttal": "You absolutely can—but here's the reality: (1) ChatGPT doesn't know your business—it hallucinates. (2) Intercom's AI is generic and expensive per-seat. (3) Freelancers ship code, not systems—who handles testing, guardrails, iteration? If you have internal bandwidth to manage all that, DIY might work. If not, you'll spend more fixing it than hiring me upfront. Want me to map out both paths in the Clarity Sprint?"
    },
    "language_coordination": {
      "objection": "We don't have anyone who speaks English well enough to coordinate this.",
      "rebuttal": "No problem—I work with a bilingual partner who handles all project coordination in Spanish. Strategy calls, documentation, milestone reviews—all in your language. The AI assistant outputs are bilingual either way. You're not forced to work in English. There's a transparent add-on cost for the bilingual partner, and I'll show you both options in the proposal."
