# Folder Structure — CushLabs Writing System

This repository implements a context-engineered AI writing system.
Each layer has a clear responsibility and strict boundaries.

---

## Root

/CLAUDE.md # System rules, workflow, priorities
/STRUCTURE.md # This file (authoritative structure)

---

## Context (Truth Layer)

Defines who you are, who you write for, and what you offer.
These files are loaded before any writing task.

/context/
/core/
voice-dna.json # Tone, cadence, phrases, never-do rules
icp.json # Ideal Customer Profile
business-profile.json # Positioning, offers, delivery model
claims-policy.json # (Optional) What can/cannot be claimed

## Skills (How to Write)

Each skill defines structure, strategy, constraints, and QA rules
for a specific content type.

Each skill lives in its own folder and contains a single,
authoritative Markdown file named after the folder.

Naming convention:

/skills/<skill-name>/<skill-name>.md

Example:

/skills/landing-page/landing-page.md

This makes skills:

- searchable by filename
- unambiguous to load
- easy to index for RAG or tooling
- resistant to drift

Current skills:
