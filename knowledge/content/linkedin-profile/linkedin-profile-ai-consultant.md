### 2. ABOUT SECTION

```
Most AI transformation projects fail. Not because the technology doesn't work — but because the strategy was fuzzy, the implementation was fragile, and nobody owned adoption.

I've spent 17 years in enterprise IT learning what actually drives organizational change. At Fortune 500 companies like Kodak and Corning, I led infrastructure modernization, system deployments, and process transformations — projects where failure meant real consequences, not a slide deck revision.

What I learned: Technology adoption isn't a tech problem. It's a clarity problem. Organizations don't resist change; they resist confusion.

Now I work at the intersection of AI strategy and implementation. I help companies move from "we should do something with AI" to "we have 50%+ of our workforce using AI weekly, with measurable productivity gains."

What I bring:

→ Strategy that connects to execution. I don't hand off recommendations and disappear. I build implementation plans tied to real metrics and own outcomes through deployment.

→ AI practitioner, not just advisor. I use AI tools daily in my own work. I've built production RAG systems, automated workflows, and trained teams on prompt engineering. I know what works and what's hype.

→ Change management credibility. I've deployed enterprise systems across resistant organizations. I know how to drive adoption — not through mandates, but through clarity and quick wins.

→ Enterprise IT discipline. Security, governance, stakeholder management, and risk awareness aren't afterthoughts. They're built into how I work.

Industries: Financial services, professional services, logistics, SaaS, manufacturing.

Looking for: AI transformation consulting roles where I can own client outcomes from strategy through execution. Particularly interested in organizations building "AI-first" workforces.
