# Skill: About Page (Credibility + Philosophy)

## Goal

Write an About page that builds trust and explains:

- who CushLabs is
- why the approach is different
- why the reader should believe you

## Triggers

Use when asked for:

- about page
- founder story
- “why CushLabs”
- credibility section

## Required context

Always load:

- /context/core/voice-dna.json
- /context/core/icp.json
- /context/core/business-profile.json
- /context/core/claims-policy.json (if present)

## Inputs

Required (assume if missing):

- Length: short | standard (default) | long
- Audience: Mexico/LATAM SMB (default) or North America

Optional:

- Emphasis: “no AI hype” | “cross-border” | “enterprise discipline” | “speed”

## Output structure (standard)

1. Opening: what CushLabs does (2–3 sentences)
2. The philosophy: “Soft landing for hard problems” (explain in plain terms)
3. Why this is different (3–5 bullets)
4. Credibility: approved proof points only
5. Who it’s for / not for (fit filter)
6. How to work together (CTA + next step)

## Style rules

- Confident, not flashy.
- Story is short and relevant; no autobiography.
- Avoid buzzwords.

## Claims rules

- Do not imply client case studies unless provided.
- Approved proof points only.

## QA checklist

- Does it feel like a premium, calm operator?
- Is the differentiation clear in 10 seconds?
- Are proof points real + specific?
