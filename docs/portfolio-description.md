# Context Engineering Kit (v2.0)

## Here's the thing:

Most people using AI to write business content end up with the same problem: the first draft sounds great, but by draft five it's drifted into generic marketing speak. You waste time editing out the hype, adding back your voice, and triple-checking that it didn't invent a feature you don't offer or a metric you can't prove.

I built this system because I got tired of fighting that battle.

## What this actually is

The Context Engineering Kit is a file structure and workflow that separates what's true about your business (your offers, your voice, your audience) from the writing tasks you repeat (landing pages, sales decks, cold emails, proposals). It's designed so AI tools can generate on-brand, claims-safe content without you having to write a novel-length prompt every single time.

Think of it as the difference between telling someone your entire life story before asking them to introduce you at a conference, versus handing them a one-page bio and letting them do their job. Same quality output, 90% less friction.

## How it works in practice

You maintain four core truth files—voice DNA, ideal client profile, business profile, and claims policy. These live in `/context/core/` and define the boundaries. What you sound like, who you're talking to, what you actually offer, and what you're allowed to claim.

Then you have Skills—one markdown file per content type (landing page, blog post, cold email, sales deck). Each Skill defines structure, rules, QA checks, and constraints specific to that format. When you ask for a landing page, the system loads your voice, your audience, your business reality, and the landing page Skill, then generates something that doesn't need 45 minutes of editing to sound like you.

The Knowledge layer stores your best examples—finished content, reusable templates, proof points. This is how the system gets better over time instead of drifting. Every polished piece becomes a reference for the next one.

## Why this is different from "just prompting better"

Prompts are instructions you give every time. Context is truth you load once.

With prompting, you're manually specifying tone, audience, constraints, and structure in every conversation. It's exhausting, inconsistent, and doesn't compound. You end up with 47 versions of "write like a calm, confident expert" scattered across chat histories.

With this system, you define those things once in structured files. The AI reads your voice DNA, knows your audience's actual pain points, and can't accidentally claim you offer services you don't. You get consistency without repetition and quality without micromanagement.

It's the difference between teaching someone to cook by narrating every step each time versus giving them a recipe book and letting them execute.

## What you get in the repository

The `/context/core/` folder holds your business truth—voice, audience, offers, claims boundaries. The `/skills/` folder contains content-type-specific instructions for landing pages, blog posts, sales decks, emails, and more. The `/knowledge/` folder stores polished examples and reusable templates. The `/prompts/` folder has interactive creators to help you build your core profiles if you're starting from scratch.

There's a system prompt file (`CLAUDE.md`) that teaches AI assistants how to use everything. Point Claude Projects, Cursor, or any other AI tool at it, and the system activates.

No hidden magic. No proprietary tools. Just markdown files, JSON for structured data, and a workflow that works in Windows, PowerShell, VS Code, or whatever you're already using.

## Who this is for

You're probably a good fit if you're running a consulting practice, productized service, or technical business where your credibility depends on sounding like yourself—not like a chatbot trained on SaaS landing pages. You produce similar content types repeatedly (proposals, case studies, LinkedIn posts, sales pages) and you're tired of editing generic AI output into something you'd actually send to a client.

This isn't for agencies managing 50 client voices. It's for operators who need their own voice to compound across every touchpoint without hiring a copywriter or becoming one.

## Technical requirements

Any AI tool that can read markdown and JSON: Claude Projects, Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT with file uploads, local LLMs with RAG. The system is model-agnostic and vendor-neutral by design.

You'll need a text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, whatever) and the ability to organize files in folders. If you can manage a GitHub repo or a Google Drive, you can run this system.

## What it doesn't do

This won't write your content for you with zero input. You still need to guide the AI, review output, and make judgment calls. It just eliminates the repetitive context-setting and the drift problem.

It also won't fix weak positioning or unclear offers. Garbage in, garbage out. If you don't know who you're talking to or what problem you solve, the system will expose that fast. That's actually a feature—it forces clarity.

## Getting started

Clone or download the repository. Run the three creator prompts in `/prompts/` to build your core profiles (voice DNA, ICP, business profile). Save those outputs to `/context/core/`. Point your AI assistant at `CLAUDE.md` as the system prompt.

Then ask for something simple: "Write a LinkedIn post about my Clarity Sprint offer." See what comes back. Iterate on your core profiles until the output sounds like you wrote it. Once it's calibrated, every subsequent asset gets easier.

The system compounds. That's the point.

## Why I'm sharing this

I built this to solve my own problem—getting AI to write in my voice without constant babysitting. Then I realized the structure itself is the valuable part, not the specific content I put in it. Your voice DNA will be different. Your ICP will be different. But the system that enforces consistency and prevents drift? That transfers.

If you're an AI consultant, technical founder, or solo operator trying to scale content production without losing your voice, this might save you 10-20 hours a month. That's worth open-sourcing.

## License and usage

MIT License. Use it, fork it, adapt it. No attribution required, but if you build something interesting on top of it, I'd be curious to see what you did.
